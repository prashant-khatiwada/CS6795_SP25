## 🧠 Theoretical Frameworks Used

- **Dual-Process Theory** – Intuition vs. analysis in medical decisions
- **Cognitive Load Theory** – How emotional stress consumes working memory
- **Thagard’s CRUM Model** – Emotions as weights in mental representations
- **Affective Neuroscience** – Neural pathways linking stress to bias

---

## 💡 Key Findings

- Emotional states like stress, empathy, and fatigue trigger **cognitive biases** such as:
  - Anchoring bias
  - Confirmation bias
  - Affect heuristic
  - Availability heuristic
- **Interventions reviewed**:
  - 🧘 Mindfulness-based cognitive strategies
  - 🤝 Emotional Intelligence training
  - 🤖 AI-powered clinical decision-support tools
